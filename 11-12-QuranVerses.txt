2:177 -
177: "Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in Allah , the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakah; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous."

6:151-153 - 
151: "Say, "Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.""
152: "And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice. We do not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you testify, be just, even if [it concerns] a near relative. And the covenant of Allah fulfill. This has He instructed you that you may remember."
153: "And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way. This has He instructed you that you may become righteous."

16:90-97 - 
Allah orders justice and good conduct, forbids immorality and oppression
Allah knows what you do
Do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong
  by taking your oaths as deceit between you b/c one community more plentiful
If Allah had willed, he could have made you of one religion
  He causes stray whom He wills and guides who He wills
Do not exchange covenant of Allah for small price
Allah outlasts everything else
Whoever does right, male of female will have a good life and be rewarded

17:26-37 - 
Give relative his right, and poor and traveler do not spend wastefully
Wasteful brothers of the devil
If you must turn away needy be gentle
Do not make your hand chained to your neck
Lord extends provisions for whom he wils
Do not kill your children for fear of poverty
  Killing is great sin
Do not approach lawful sexual intercourse
Do not kill the soul which Allah has dorbidden
Do not approach propert of an orphan, except in best way until he is mature
  Fulfill every commitment
Do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge
Do not walk upon earth exultantly. You will never tear the earth apart

23:96 - 
96: "Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most knowing of what they describe."

31:14-19 - 
We have enjoined upon man for his parents
  Be grateful to Me and to your parents
If parents do not associate with Me don't obey but accompany them with kindness
Establish prayer, do what is right and be patient
Do not turn your cheek toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly
Be moderate in pace and lower your voice
  the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys

33:35 - 
35: "Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward."

42:36-39 - 
Whatever thing you have been given. It is but for enjoyment of life
  But what is with Allah is better
Those who avoid major sins and immortality when they are angry they forgive
Those who have responded to lord and establish prayer, from what We provided they spend
And those who tyranny strikes they defend themselves

Fundamental attitude of ingratitude manifested by takdhib = giving lie to God
Kufr used as an antonym of iman
  In Quran most representative opposite of mumin is kafir


== The Element of Ingratitude in the Kufr ==
secular use of the word kufr, brings out a really striking element of ingratitude
kufr presented as an attitude of man towards God impossible to go God towards man
God shows himself thankful to man for all the good works he does
  God will never ignore good services rendered by a sincere believer
shukr = thankfulness
man's kufr becomes evident when one observes conduct in time of distress
Most men are ungrateful

word kanud that used proximately the same meaning as kafur
root KND = "to be ungrateful and to refuse to acknowledge any benefit"


== Kufr as Opposed to Iman ==

  hearts cannot perceive religious significance of anything
    remain blind and deaf to divine signs
  kafirs physically without defect, their hearts are defected
  "they are but as cattle. nay they are father astray from the way"


== Kufr & Shirk == 
kufr can be associated with polytheism
  term for polytheism is shirk
  term for idolator mushrik = 'one who associates'

== Hawa as the Immediate Cause of Dala ==

    Noah in the Quran
=========================

71 - 
Sent Noah to his people saying "Warn your people"
Noah went to warn them, but they ignored him and were arrogant
Because of sins they were drowned and put into the Fire

7 - 
Noah sent to people, worship Allah the only diety lalala
Eminent among people: "Indeed we see you in clear error"
They denied him, so we saved him and those with him
DROWNED those who denied our signs, indeed they were blind people

23 - 
We sent Noah to his people
Noah is a man wanting to take precedence, if Allah willed he would have sent messenger
WE HAVE NOT HEARD THIS FROM OUR FOREFATHERS
Build a ship under us, and put into ship two mates and your family
Those who have wronged will be drowned

29 - 
We sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them 1000 years - 50 years
Flood seized them while they were wrongdoers, saved companions of the ship

11 - 
Noah went to people.. we see you as followed by only the weakest
  Called Noah a liar
Oh Noah, you have disputed us. Bring us what you threatened us
Noah built ship, son was a disbeliever 
Son climbed a mountain to protect but drowned in waves
Water went away and ship came to rest
Noah called to Lord -> Son is not of your family


=========================
    Noah in the Bible
=========================

5 - 
Noah was 500 years old, begat Shem, Ham and Japheth

6 - 
Men multiplied and daughters born
Wickedness of man great
Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created
Generation of Noah

God decides to destroy so tells Noah to make him an ark
Dimensions of the ark given
For 40 days and nights it will rain and destroy everyone
Noah 600 years old when flooded
Sons got into ark, no mention of the son who died
No real mention of going to try and warn the people
The raven in the bible and the dove

9 - 
God blessed Noah and his sons, multiply!
Establishes covenant with them and children

Sehm Ham and Japheth his sons, (Ham father of Canaan)
Ham sees drunk Noah naked one night in his tent
SHem and Japheth take a garment and cover their dad
Noah says cursed be Canaan
Canaan will be Shem's servant
Noah dies at 950 years old

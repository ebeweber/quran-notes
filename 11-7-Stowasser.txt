    Stowasser on Mary in the Quran
======================================

In the Quran Mary is the only female identified by name
Her name appears far more in Quranic text than in the entire New Testament
  Her name is the title of Sura 19

From birth she was surrounded by miracles
As young woman, she received the angelic annuciation of a child from God's spirit
Mary is an example for believers because of her chastitity, obedience and faith

In the Quran her story intertwined with that of her guardian, prophet Zacharia
Zacharia's prayer for a child in old age and the birth of John
  These instances precede Quranic passages of Mary's sinless conception
  Angels' words on birth of John to Zacharia almost identical with those of birth of Jesus to Mary
Both question.. "How shall I have a son", both told "God does what He wills"
Wording of God's praise and blessing of John almost identical to Jesus' words about himself, spoken in the cradle
Quran awards more prominence to Mary and Jesus, Zacharia's wife remains a figure apart
  Only in exegesis is she linked with Mary



== Wife of Prophet Zacharia and Mother of Prophet John in Quran ==

Woman's name not mentioned, revelation speaks of her righteousness and God's favor in restoring her from barrenness and getting motherhood
Zacharia prays to God in secret for a son to be successor
Given a son named John (Yahya) name not before given
Zacharia didn't believe asked for sign 
  He would not speak for 3 nights and would communicate through signs only
  He did and son born
  John was really good - [insert good qualities here]

== Islamic Interpretation ==

Zacharia's wife was idenitifed as Elisabeth
Zacharia part of Solomonic line
Elisabeth is sister of Mary's mother Anna
  Seen as resembling Sara in that blessed with child in old age
Some traditions speak of meeting with Mary while both pregnant
  Elisabeth told Mary her own unborn child prostrate himself in obeisance before child in Mary's womb
  Signifies that prophet Jesus stood above John b/c God made him resurrect the dead and heal blind
In contemporary works on Quranic figures Elizabeth not mentioned



== Mary the Mother of the Prophet Jesus ==

Mary only female identified by name
Mary name of Sura, most other Sura named after prophets
Before birth Mary's mother consecrated her to God's service
  After born invoked protection for her and her progeny
  Both Mary & Jesus escaped pricking of the devil at birth
God's angels spoke to Mary
God cast his spirit into Mary.. He sent his spirit to Mary to give her a pure son
  Was Mary then a Quranic prophet?????
    Zahirite school found proof in fact that God's angels informed her of things to come
    Neither mainstream doctrine or recognized her
      Belief mainly just that she was different from other Quranic women

Sura 19
Mary withdrew to an eastern place, took a screen to hide herself
We sent spirit to her and took shape of human
  I'm here to give you a boy -- how can I have a boy if no human has touched me and I am not a whore
She was pregnant and retired him to a remote place. Pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of palm tree
Shake the paml tree and it will drop juicy fresh dates upon you
When you see a human don't talk, you have vowed not to talk
Jesus talks as a baby.. "I am God's slave. He has given me the Book and made me a prophet.."
Both mary and Jesus a sign

Sura 3
Mary's mom is like I have given birth to her a female uh oh
Placed under protection from Satan
Lord puts her in charge with Zacharia

Sura 66 
Establishes Mary's status as an example for the believers
Mary the daughter of Amram who was chaste

Sura 4 and 5 emphasize Mary's chastity but also her and Jesus' full humanity
Refutes idea that Jesus and Mary formed part of the trinity
Do not say: THREE
Christ is strictly a messenger, mother is women of truth


== Islamic Interpretation of Mary

Post-Quranic exegesis came to perceive purpose of revelations on Mary as clariication of true natures of Jesus and Mary

Hadith and Tafsir dealt with Mary is different ways..
1. Miraculous events surrounding birth and childhood developed and expanded upon in the hagiographic mode
2. Scholar of Islam found number of problems for debate and dogmatic formulation
  Meaning of spirit and word that virgin received
  Is Mary one of God's prophets
  Mary's relationship with Eve in consideration of her rank above "women of the worlds"
    Is she superiour to early figures such as Pharaoh's wife etc.
3. Religious authorities have attempted to define social applicability of her qualities
  Qualities suited for emulation by Muslim women

Now..

== Story in Haiographic Extension
Largely elimnated. Low priority compared to exegetic emphasis that the story's core is affirmation of God's oneness
Traditions report Mary's mother Anna longing for child
  Moved by bird brooding over young
Anna conceived. Assuming boy she consecrated unborn child to God. God accepted anyways.
B/c of her prayer to God neither Mary or Jesus touched at birth by Satan
  Happens to other human beings explains why they cry
Zacharia awarded privelege of care after parents die
She was devout feet would swell..
She lived in the mithrad which only Zacharia had the key
  She would be locked in the room
  She would have wondrous provisions. Summer fruit during winter vise versa
Eventually Zacharia has John
  Prayed for son out of season
Mary hits puberty and "sees horrible thing"
She was removed from worship to wife's care until pure again. 
Among people who served with Mary in temple Jospeh is mentioned

Angels approach Mary when alone
At a well in the wilderness or an isolated place during period..?
Gabriel comes down in form of handsome man (other maintain maybe Joseph)
Idenitication of spirit with Gabriel bad because it says "I am only your Lord's.."
Solved by making Gabriel medium
Gabriel could not create life in her because he was created body
  Gabriel blowing of His spirit (Gabriel the medium)
Somehow breath reached her womb
Traditions say Joseph the first to notice, confronted by asking if crop could grow without seeds, child without a father.. she said yes
Mary/Elisabeth meet and John prostrates before Jesus
When alone Jesus would speak with Mary
Time of carrying varies from 9 months to no time
Birthpains drive her to trunk of tree where she wishes she had died
  God give dates and water as gift
Mary stayed with child in place for 40 days
Some say people went looking and found her
  idols collapsed, satans confused 
  star rose in sky
  Persian king sent gold, myrrh and frankincense
  Syrian king planned to kill Jesus
  Mary then fled to Egypt where she stayed
^^ Reject by denying anyone went in search

Mary impregnated by Our Spirit
Casting of spirit into Mary recalls gift of God's spirit to Adam
Spirit identified as Gabriel
Islamic exegesis differentiates between Our God's spirit sent to Mary in form on man and spirit breathed into Mary
  First one is Gabriel latter is life substance with which God awakened Adam
  Classical ->   Gabriel was the means of God's creative power
  Contemporary -> God's spiritin form of human different entity than spirit breathed into Mary
  ^^ Not very interesting issue

Classical -> recorded different interpretations of meaning of Jesus as "word of God"
  Razi says "word" is metaphorical" meaning..
    God's creative power
    Gospel, essence of Jesus' prophetic mission
    Word means God's message to Mary about birth
Fundamentalist places notion of Jesus as word as above human understanding, not our concern

Was Mary a Prophet?
Zahirite say Mary, Sara and mother of Moses all prophets b/c angels spoke to them
  a Zahirite Hazm said women can be prophet but not messengers so kind of in favor
Hazm thinks Mary prophet when also called woman of truth
Sunni reject this 
  Couldn't be pure b/c women cannot be pure because of menstruation

Purity usually signifies state without menstruation and ritual preceding it
Quran angels announce God has purified her (doesn't signify physically)
  Hadith generally say that Mary woman like all others physically
Before the annuciation she had a few cycles
Some interpreters say her purity included menstruation
Modernist Abduh - ^^ that allowed her to be in temple
Some interpreters consider Mary a many
  she attained standard of men
(question of Mary's virginity after Jesus disregarded)

Quran proclaims Mary as devoutly obedient
Questioning of angel and wishing she was dead could be viewed as rebellion
Exegesis holds up obedience

First choosing as God's aceeptance of Mary for His service
Second is gift of Jesus without a father, childs words in Mary's defense
Is Mary woman over all women of her time or of all time..???
Mary ranks higher than Muhammad's daughter Fatima?
  Both very similar
  Both share not menstruating 
  Both have kids ladadada

  Sunni - Fatima suffering linked with Muhammad's death
  Shi'i - grieving mother whose short life made bitter by foreknowledge of future martydom son Husayn

  Quran says Jesus persecuted and reject but ot slain
    Strong affinities between Jesus and Husayn
Some say they are equal
  Shi'i say Fatima above

Hadith expanded Adam and Eve to where Mary is like Adam, Jesus Eve
Jesus created from Mary without man and swapped -- WOAH

Important aspects of Mary's nature remain beyond what Muslim woman can, should strie to equal
Exegesis use text to derive moral lessons
Mary withdrawing has been interpreted as Mary's desire for gender based segregation and onset of puberty
  she is said to have donned the face-veil

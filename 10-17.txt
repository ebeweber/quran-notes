Full bus in Egypt - Quran comes on a unified silence
Spirit came over passengers
  animating or vital principle; a supernatural being; a temper or disposition
  Recitation based on patterns of breath

Much of discussion of spirit in Quran is attempt to define it as a particular being-as Gabriel..

Sound figure
  aspect of Quranic articulation
  particularly subte developed within suras
  occur in connection with 3 moments: prophecy, creation and the day of reckoning

Gender is a vital spect of sound figures
Revealed when society male leaders were male
Gender dynamic has balance

ruh - both masculine and feminine


Prophecy - 
  Lanugage of revelation is caught in dilemma of boundaru moment
  Arabic verbs are either perfect or imperfect
  Switching between these two destabilizes normal distinction between complete and ongoing time
  Spirit comes as male to Maryam - at first she is worried about his attentions
  Sura of destiny based upon partially completed personification of night as woman
    Never made explicit
  
Creation - 
  What occurred before the creation of the world?
  To ask what happened before the creation of the world creates a category of time before time
  World is a deeper reality of the generosity of its creator

  sawwa - word that means to knead, mold, form or shape
  When something shaped spirit breathed into it
  ha - pronoun that can mean her or it
  basharan sawiyyan - a human that has been shaped

  hu / ha are pronouns
  use context to figure out - maryam uncomfortable
  
Reckoning
  Day of reckoning is a boundary moment, an intersection of time and eternity
  hawiya - a mother who has lost her child, an abyss, a fall or desire
    ha in this break up the word aww yeah

The Sign and the Spirit
  Relationship between sign to both gender is also stressed in story of Maryam's conception
  Substitution theory where words shortened
  sometimes ha can mean her or him
  gender dynamic sometimes lost
  Three boundaries (prophecy, creation, and reckoning) personification of woman giving birth
  Each sound combination picks up relationship to the other variations

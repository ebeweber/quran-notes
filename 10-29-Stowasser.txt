The Wife of the Prophet Adam in the Quran

Quran speaks of Adam and his wife in several Suras
Quran does not mention Adams wife by name and does not mention how she was created
Woman appears in 3/5 accounts of Adam in the Quran -
  Emphasis lies with disobedience of the human towards God
  One's that don't mention emphasize Iblis and his rebeliion

Quran together..
  Adam created from clay, mud moulded into shape
  Adam's nature included spark which God granted to the human beyond all other creatures
  Adam was to be God's ciegerent
  Endowed him with knowledge concerning natures of things
  Knowledge above the angels
  Iblis' role linked with man

  In only the second half does the woman appear
  First mentioned as "Adam's partner in God's injunction to dwell in garden"

  Sura 20 - To Adam whom God addressed the warning that Iblis was his and his wife's enemy
  If he let Iblis get the ejected, Adam would be landed in misery
  Also Adam that Satan whispered his temptation
  Adam who disobeyed his Lord

  Sura 7 - 
  Mentions woman's participation
  "Statan whispered to them in twain"

  Sura 20 - 
  God chose Adam and forgave him and guided him

  Sura 7 - 
  Both man and woman asked for forgiveness

Noldeke places Suras in following chrono order: 20, 15, 38, 7, 2

20 - 
  God's warning, temptation and forgiveness are all directed at Adam
    Even though both man and woman eat and are expelled
15/38 - 
  Speak of Adam's creation and Iblis' rebellion, banishment and curse
  Man's disobedience not part, woman not mentioned
7 - 
  Both male and female tempted and tricked, both repent and are banished
2 - 
  Emphasizes Adam's creation, warning addressed to both
  No temptation / seduction scene - merely mention that is was Satan who caused the slip

Dynamic of narrative procede from a focus on Adam to one involving both Adam and his wife; the final version transcends both by way of introducing the notions of man's vicegerency on earth, God's given inspiration etc.


Classical Muslim Interpretation
  Departs from scripturalist referent in many ways
  Extra detail transmitted in Hadith from and Bible/Bibe-sources drastically change the story

  Hadith - 
    The first woman stands for her sex
    Inferior nature accepted until 18th century reformist began to question
    Since 19th century Islamic modernists have denied autheniticy 
  Medieval interpretation of woman's origin and nature denies rationality and responsibility
    Signifies social base of inequality


al-Tabari 
  Wrote his Hadith based commentary in 9th and 10th centuries
  Adam because God sent angel of death who scooped up good ground and bad etc (adim)
  Adam was lonely without a mate
  God cast slumber over him, took rib, and created wife Hawwa' in form of woman

  Hawwa' appears only in Hadith
  She way created from a living thing (hayy)
  Most traditions place her creation in stay in Garden, some maintain before

  Blames the woman, majority opinion that through woman's weakness that Satan could bring Adam's downfall
  Iblis snuck in bellyof a snake, and approached Hawwa, then Hawwa went to action
  Other report that Hawwa commanded husband to eat
  Else sexual desire or intoxication made to explain absence of Adam's rational powers
  Had been Iblis main goal to make them aware of genitals
    Knew they had organs because he had read the angel's books
  Adam had not been aware since they were clothed in al-zufr
  Adam, not Hawwa who was overcome with shame
  God put curse on snake and woman
    Did not curse the man
  Curse Adam with life of want and work
  Woman involved constitution of mental abilities
    Condemned to bleed, and deliver child painfully
    Woman foolish and stupid
  Snake cursed to slither naked on its belly
  Taberi indicates both man and woman acknowledge sin and asked for forgiveness
    Larger number reports eternal life involved only Adam


Zamakhshari expanding on Tabari's notion that genitals and evil derived from same Arabic root
Places emphasis on appearance of first couple's nakedness as sign of sin
At first glance not interested in her role in humankind's primeval error
  Sin was minor
Mainly to support Muzantile definition of sin, not exonerate Hawwa
To Zamak Hawwa is guilty
On Adam's deathbed angels surround, Adam told Hawwa to leave angels alone b/c what happened was her fault
  Hawwa not allowed to participate

Fakhr al-Din Razi is regarded as most brilliant defense against Mutazilite exegesis
  Includes lots of Hadith material found in Tabari
  Goes beyond immediate story
    Garden on earth or in heaven
    Adam's sin minor or major
    Sin occured before or after call to prophethood
  Razi says would command woman to prostrate herself to man (angels prostrate to glorify Adam not worship)
  Razi questions free will as opposed to predestination
    Chain of disobedience in God's intention
  Logically, Razi concludes Iblis must have seduced Adam directly without woman's interference
    uninterested in salvagin woman's role
  Satan could have tempted woman just like the snake (merely an animal)
  Razi emphasizes woman was Adam's follower while he repented
  "toil" imposed on Adam alone because a man must also toil for his wife


Quranic Tafsir of al-Baydawi
  identifies the garden as abode or perpetuity, identical within Paradise or located somewhere in ME
  Uncovering of genitals is the first evil which man obtained from Satan

Tafsir of Kathir
  Adam's sojourn in the Garden lasted equivalent of time between afternoon prayer and sunset paryer (130 years of earthly time)
  Began and ended on the day of Adam's creation
  WOman's lower moral, mental and physical nature



Egyptian theologian Muhammad Abduh
  Main goal was to renew Muslim morality and reform traditional social structures of his day
  Pays attention to time and place of revelation, emphaiszes literal meaning and context, de-emphasizes Hadith
    Seeks to rediscover original meaning of the Quran
  Places great importance on notions of woman's full humanity and equality with man before God
    Both b/c Quranic but indispensible in shaping truly moral society
  Hawwa's creation from rib, has no foundation in text, represent unreliable foreign materials
  Adam's story is meant to serve as example of admonition and guidance
  Story has nothing to do with histroy

  Faultiness of Biblical creation lies in its claim to be history
  Adam signifies the human specifies, includes his wife
  Command to dwell in Garden and eat freely signifies "command of creation and inspiration of what is good"
    Tree is man's God given knowledge of what is evil
  Exodus from Garden is parable for hardship of human encountes
  Repentence forgiveness mean human nature is not flawed, God's guidance restored
    Refutes Christian doctrine that man was lost until saved


1940s - al Maraghu
  Continued to utilize much of traditionalist detail Abduh had disgarded
  Blames Hawwa'
  Hawwa who suggested that Adam should eat of the Tree, since the woman was created to suggest to the man what she desires


Lots of people used story of Hwwa to reflect ideological / personal perspectives
Best known 1950s penned by misogynist Egyptian writer Abbas al-Aqqad
  celebrate woman's unique unprecendant writes in Islam
  Story of Tree symbolizes every female trait, women's desire for forbidden, ignorance, coyness, impatience..
  Female will is negative while male is positive
  Female power derived from males sexual desire
  Female strongest suit is power of hypocrisy
  To preserve strength of species man given power to coerce woman into submission
  Had women been given power of coercion she could only coerce weakest males
  Women derive pleasure from pain

  Aqqad's work a widely read oddity

Contemporary consevative voices continue to emphasize equality of sexes in Islam but stipulate equality as more complements

Breaking of rib signifies divorce
Neither man nor woman inferior

Contempory fundamentalist
Woman created for wifehood and motherhood
Woman is warrior of faith

    Quran on Solomon / Queen of Sheba
===========================================

34:10-17 - 
David given birds and some other bullshit
Solomon given the wind, made flow for him spring of liquid copper
Among the junn were those who worked for Solomon
  They made for him what he willed
We ordered Solomon's death, nothing indicated jinn except a creature of earth eating his staff
Tribe of Saba' in dwelling place a sign
  two gardens -- eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful
  They turned away refusing, so we went upon them flood of the dam

21:78-82 - 
David and Solomon when the judged concerning the field, We witnessed
Gave understanding and knowledge to the two
Solomon subjected the wind, proceeding by his command
Devils were those who dived for him and did work other than that

27:15-44 - 
David and Solomon given knowledge
Solomon inherited David, saying we have been taught lanugage of birds
Solomon controlled jinn and men and birds
Came upon ants.. ants enter dwellings that you may not be crushed
A bird was missing where is he -- I will punish him or slaughter unless he explains
Bird comes and says I come to you from Sheba
  Found woman ruling, given of all things, has great throne
  People prostrate to the sun but not Allah
  Do not prostrate Allah who brings forth what is hidden
Solomon gives bird letter and says leave we will see what they return
Messengers go to Solomon --
  Do you provide me with wealth? What Allah has given to me is better than what he has given you.. but it is you who rejoice
Solomon assembles jinn and says bring me her throne
Solomon says disguise her throne, we will see if she guided to truth or not guided
She thinks it is her throne
She was told to enter palace.. but she thought it was water and uncovered her shins to wade through
  It was a palace whose floor made of glass. 
She says My Lord I have wronged myself I submit yayaya

38:17-26 - 
Be patient, remember David possessor of strength
Gave David all kinds of strength and birds
Two adversaries come..
  One has 99 sheep the other has 1. 
David says he has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his
Many associates oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous deeds
David judge between poeple.

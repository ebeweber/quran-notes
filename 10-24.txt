Bible (Gen.1 - Gen.3)
A short summary of key things noticed

In beginning God created heavens and earth
Empty at first made light and the sky
Made land, made land produce plants
Created life
Created mankind in our image to rule over animals


Formed a man from the dust of the ground
  Breathed into nostrils life
garden of Eden to put man
River watering garden flowed from Eden
  Four headwaters
    Pushon winds through land of gold
    Gihon winds through land of Cust
    Tigris runs along east side of Ashur
    Euphrates is fourth
Eat anywhere but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil
Adam need helper, nobody suitable so he took man's ribs and made a woman
Adam and Eve naked and felt no shame


Serpent more crafty than any tempts them
"You will not die your eyes will be opened and you will be LIKE God"
Woman eats first and gives some to her husband
Realize they were naked and made clothes
God is walking through garden, they hide because they are naked
Man says, "The woman you put here with me- she gave me fruit and I ate it"
God curses the serpant
To women, "I will make childbearing pains severe, desire will be for husband and he will rule over you"
To man, "You will have to work until you die, from dust to dust"
Adam names wife Eve, not God
God banished him from Garden of Eden to work ground from which he had taken
Placed of east side of Garden of Eden cherubim and flaming sword to guard the way to tree of life

=======================================

Belief is the fountainhead of all Islamic virtues

The Ideal Believer
When God is mentioned their hearts quiver, listens to signs, rely etc
Genuine faith must work as most powerufl motive that actuates men to good works, if not faith isn't genuine
basic attitude of hilm

Iman, Belief as Opposed to Kufr

Islam and Muslim
islam means submission and muslim is one who surrendered
islam and iman are different
Islam is very first step in faith, all believers are muslims but reverse is not true

Divine Guidance
guidance of god, religion is to be rightly guided
belief is accepting the guidance, while kufr is turning that way

Fear of God
taqwa - fear of God
fear of Last Judgement 
to believe in God means to fear him
one who trembles in fear before GOd

Thanfulness
shukr thankfuless and taqwa represent two proper types of reactions to God's signs

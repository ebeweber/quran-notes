Notes for 9/26 Reading: 
Mattson, 79-113 & 127-135


79-113:

The Voice and The Pen
  A Sacred Pedigree
      Kurdi has survived the 20th century. A time of a lot of change in ideals.
      Kurdi has one goal: to fulfill his duty to transmit Quran to another generation
      28th person in chain of people to translate

      Reem is a young girl, studies the Quran
      Working to memorize Quran
      Wants to obtain certificate (ijaza) from scholar with chain (isnad)
      Assigned female reciter (murqia) who taught her rules of beautiful recitation (tajwid)
      Constantly working with trainer through a process called "probing" (sabr)
      Had to go to someone before Kurdi to prove she was good enough to recite
      Reem goes and gets her certificate, recites loud and clearly (yay)
      Certificate tracks chain all the way back to Muhammad

      Certificate says she has memorized Quran with mastery and tajwid, the Sheikh examined her, and she is certified to recite and teach. Never turn back on student or the Quran.





  Recited & Written
    Quran does not contain workds of Muhammad - they are God's words
    isnad - a solid chain of transmission
    When reciting Quran words of God reproduced in throats of human (closer than jugular vein)
    Recitation precedes writing Overtime more and more textual signifiers were used to make written Quran independently readable




  The Prophet and the First Collection of the Quran
    Gabriel gave Muhammad revelations, but also visited to review what he learned and review revelations
    Quran revealed in Prophet's own tongue, revealed little by little
    Prophet would recite old and new allowing Companions to learn
    When talking to potential converts he would often recite

    During 10 years in Medina, Prophet would appoint individuals to teach Quran to new Muslims
    Due to nature of time, it was very easy to memorize all of that information

    Writing material expensive and scarce
    Arabic script was rudimentary, no way to write everything down
    Ex. kitab written ktb but this could also signify kutub, kataba, kutiba because it was a consonantal system
    Prophet didn't know how to write
    As long as Prophet alive suras were potential incomplete - at any time revisions could be made

    20 years after death of prophet series of written compilations made
    Some differences - recorded in 2 stages:
        Initial compilation took place about a year after death during Abu Bakr
          Many Muslims killed in Battle of Yamama - Khattab (2nd caliph) told Bakr concerned with number of reciters and advised him to collect the Quran so it wouldn't disappear 
          Thabit told to undertake the task
    
          Zayd is in the first generation of transmitters
          Rather than writing down, he searched for written transcriptions and passages
          Collected them on things, Bakr said to have kept
        
        Second project occured during reign of third caloph
          Concern over impetus of recitations
          Different regions different recitations
          "Put this community in order before they dispute over the Book like the disputes of the Jews and the Christians"
          Uthman ordered Zayd to form committee to write out complete transcription
          Muhammad said to have allowed Quran to be recited in different ahruf - this was lost
          Variants due to ambiguity meant variant pronounciations allowed
          Fixed the order of the suras
          Ordered other versions be destroyed

          ** Wansbrough argues Quran composed at later date, resembles little of what the prophet said




  The Early Generations: Regional Schools of Recitation and the Elaboration of the Mushaf
    Uthman killed by political oponents as he recited the Quran
    Khawariju ("secessionist") - idealistic, uncompromising, radical, violent men who terralized men living in central lands of Islam
    By end of first century of Islam, Muslims had roamed far
    Quran became increasingly standardized, Arabic markings began to show up

    Second Century
      Additional textual signifiers
      Regional differences emerged

    Second/Third Century 
      Number of lines on a page regulized
      Titles added
      More use made of gold and decorative elements

      


  Standardizing the Curriculum
    During 3rd century, institutions of religion accelerated
    By end of 3rd century particular schools of thought became dominant in all these field - establishing foundation of Sunni and Shiite identities
    No scholar could claim authority to teach unless they had learned from another scholar
    Calligraphy desirable skill, many women calligraphers
    TL;DR: Formalized study and interpretation




  Quranic Recitation and Ritual Life
    Quran recited in five prayers daily
    In traditional Muslim societies many different events, contemporary many have been shunned but Romadan remains
    Fasting to heighten one's awareness to God
    Quran revealed during month of Ramadan, Gabriel reviewed every Ramadan
    Whole Quran recited, parts at a time
    Tajwid indicated how each letter is pronounced, does not indicate speed or pitch
    Disputes on whether it should be melody/musical in recitation
    ...




127-135:

  Transmission of the Quran in the Modern Age
    Using of technology for religious purposes (printing press)
    On other hand, printing press used to bypass traditional scholars
    Many scholars objected, scribing not just a job but an act of worship (meticulously correct)
      Printing press could not form intention to worship, etc.
    Could not hold back technology, turned efforts towards ensuring accuracies

    Some of qiraat which had been dominant in certain regions marginalized
    2nd time after transcribing to paper, that technology made mushaf more accessible
    Different colors for different sounds

    20th century recordings played on the radio - could memorize without personal relationship with scholar

    murattal and mujawwad recitations - 
      mujawwad too musical and served interests of artsy people

    Many Egyptian reciters
      Egypt major center of influence in Sunni Islam

    Not many women reciters online or recordings
    "improper" for men to listen to women reciting




  Conclusion
    Over centuries, Muslims have committed to preserving and trasmitting the Quran
    Muslims have used every means:
      Parchment
      Paper & Ink
      Slate & Chalk
      Printing Press
      Audo Cassettes
      Internet
    Quran taught and studied everywhere
    Many people have roots that have been broken

    Islamic eschatology holds that some day, every chain of transmission will crease; all links will disapper:
    "Everything on will perish; but the face of your Lord, full of majesty and dignity will abide."
    But for now the transmission continues..

51:56-57 - 
56: "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."

18:50 - 
50: "And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange."

46:29-31 - 
29: "And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, "Listen quietly." And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners."
30: "They said, "O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path."
31: "O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allah and believe in him; Allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment."

55:14-15 - 
14: "He created man from clay like [that of] pottery."
15: "And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire."

72: 1-15 - 
1: "Say, [O Muhammad], "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an."
2: "It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone."
3: "And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son"
4: "And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression."
5: "And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie."
6: "And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden."
7: "And they had thought, as you thought, that Allah would never send anyone [as a messenger]."
8: "And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames."
9: "And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing, but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him."
10: "And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course."
11: "And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways."
12: "And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight."
13: "And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden."
14: "And among us are Muslims [in submission to Allah ], and among us are the unjust. And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course."
15: "But as for the unjust, they will be, for Hell, firewood.'"

Qur'an: Human Nature

30:30 - 
30: "So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah . That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know."

95:4-5 - 
4: "We have certainly created man in the best of stature;"
5: "Then We return him to the lowest of the low,"

70:19-21 -
19: "Indeed, mankind was created anxious:"
20: "When evil touches him, impatient,"
21: "And when good touches him, withholding [of it],"

4:128 -
128: "And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them - and settlement is best. And present in [human] souls is stinginess. But if you do good and fear Allah - then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."

21:37 - 
37: "Man was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not impatiently urge Me."

11:9-10 - 
9: "And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful."
10: "But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him, he will surely say, "Bad times have left me." Indeed, he is exultant and boastful -"

41:49-51 - 
49: "Man is not weary of supplication for good [things], but if evil touches him, he is hopeless and despairing."
50: "And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, "This is [due] to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best." But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment."
51: "And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive supplication."

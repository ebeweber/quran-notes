57: "I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me."

38:27 - 
27: "And We did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire."

23:115 -

17:44 - 
44: "The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [ Allah ] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving."

24:41-3 -
41: "Do you not see that Allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and [by] the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and exalting [Him], and Allah is Knowing of what they do."
42: "And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the destination."
43: "Do you not see that Allah drives clouds? Then He brings them together, then He makes them into a mass, and you see the rain emerge from within it. And He sends down from the sky, mountains [of clouds] within which is hail, and He strikes with it whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of its lightening almost takes away the eyesight."

Qur'an: Human Nature

30:30 - 
30: "So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah . That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know."

95:4-5 - 
4: "We have certainly created man in the best of stature;"
5: "Then We return him to the lowest of the low,"

70:19-21 -
19: "Indeed, mankind was created anxious:"
20: "When evil touches him, impatient,"
21: "And when good touches him, withholding [of it],"

4:128 -
128: "And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them - and settlement is best. And present in [human] souls is stinginess. But if you do good and fear Allah - then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."

21:37 - 
37: "Man was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not impatiently urge Me."

11:9-10 - 
9: "And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful."
10: "But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him, he will surely say, "Bad times have left me." Indeed, he is exultant and boastful -"

41:49-51 - 
49: "Man is not weary of supplication for good [things], but if evil touches him, he is hopeless and despairing."
50: "And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, "This is [due] to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best." But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment."
51: "And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive supplication."

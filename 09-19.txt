09/19 Reading - Izutsu Chapter 5 (74-104, the Islamization of the old Arab virtues)


In many important respects Islam broke completely with the old paganism
  But, the Quran adopted and reviewed many of the outstanding virtues of paganism
Many of these old traits used to describe Muhammad

Generosity
  In desert acts of generosity necessary aspect of struggle for existence
  pagan Arabs closely associated generosity with 'honor'
    acts of generosity held as proof of genuine nobility
  prophet palces high value on charity
  Difference - 
    Islam denied all value to acts of generosity from the desire to make a show
    Dandyism or  chivalry for its own sake was in this view nothing but a satanic passion
    What is important is not generosity, but the motive underlying it
  generosity is different from boastful charity
  almsgiving falls under personal ethics, not social duty
  Disgraceful to be cast by one's own hands to ruin, more disgraceful to be called a 'niggard'
  Target of condemnation not niggardliness in general, but in sphere of religion and almsgiving

Courage
  pagan version very aggressive and violent
    courage unrestrained and unrestrainable impulse
  In Islam no longer a blind, unruly impulse
    Noble, well disciplined courage with lofty aim at serving the cause of religion
  Courage has definite direction 

Loyalty 
  Jahili loyalty a matter of kinship by blood
    Ex. someone asked to surrender coats of mail committed to him, man not even relative son was slaughtered
  New loyalty - 
    in the sphere of ordinary relationships
    religious sphere pertaining to God
  virtue of wafa - having been born of particular consciousness of blood fellowship produced by a solemn ceremony of sacrifice
  sacrifice between tribes to enter an agreement
  wafa became force of operating in an individualistic society

  sidq - for statemnt to be sidq not enough that word conform to reality;
    they should conform to the idea of reality in the mind of the speaker
  Day of Jugement will separate the class of sidq and kafir
  God is sidq - rue in all things
  siddiq - exaggeration, one who speaks nothing but the truth, never lies
    not one who speaks truth but one who testifies to the truth of something

  sidq - truth-speaking and faithfulness
  ..

Veracity
  Truth is fundamentally relationship between two poles, sidq and haqq
  haqq is the objective side of the truth
    language can be true only when it conforms to it
  kadhib - blasphemous attitude towards god
  Batil - idols
  takdhib - flat denial of devine relation, refusal to accept Truth

  Jahiliyah regulated by elaborate system of taboos, this was forbidden
  Haram-Halal system - 
    forbidden law system imposed upon all men as something sacrosanct
  Quran condemns 'sacred' customs of Jahilayah

Patience 
  Part of courage
  In desert need to show patience and endurance
    courage needed to be backed by patience
  'patience in the way of God'
  Patience is that aspect of belief which it shows when it finds itself in unfavorable conditions

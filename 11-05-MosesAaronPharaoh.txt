  Moses / Aaron / Pharaoh in the Quran
=========================================

28 - 
Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections
Slayed their sons only keeping alive the females
Sent inspiration to mother of Moses: Suckle until thou hast fears about him, cast him into river
Pharaoh's wife says slay him not
Moses' mother almost reveals, but We strengthen her faith
When he reached full age, he was established with wisdom and knowledge
Entered city, found two men fighting - killed a man
  Prays to lord and asks for forgiveness
Next day finds more men fighting.. warned he is going to be killed so leaves
Runs away and find some poeple
  Finds girls with old father and helps them out
Man weds daughter on condition Moses works
He was travelling with his family when perceives fire
Sees the bush in bank of valley
Wants Aaron to come (brother) he is better in speech
Moses goes and they respond this is nothing but sorcery faked
Pharaoh says light me a thing to make bricks, build palace so he may mount up to God of Moses
We revealed to Moses the Book after destroying earlier generations

20-
Moses saw fire. Talks to God.
Two signs is the rod and the hand thing
Moses says, "ease the task and remove the impediment from my speech so they may understand what I say"
  "give me aaron too"
Reminded of all the saving God did with his mom and the fight - he will be okay
Pharaoh rejects and refuses the signs
The two disputed over the affair but kept talk secret
Magicians to battle moses..
  Throws staff and swallows the magicians fakes
Magicians thrown down to prostration
Pharaoh not happy, believe before I give you permission!
  Magicians don't care. Lord is super powerful.
Moses told to travel by night and to strike a dry path for them through the sea without sea
  Pharaoh pursued but the waters completely overwhelmed them
We delivered you from enemy, made Covenant with children of Israel on Mt. Sinai, and sent down Manna
When Moses on Mt. the people go astray
Samiri has them throw things in fire, brings out a calf
  Calf is your God
  Aaron is like what the fuck, but they won't abandon until Moses returns
Moses says Aaron what kept thee back from when they did wrong

26 - 
Lord calls Moses to go to the people of iniquity
  Moses worried that they will not fear Allah or believe him
  Also afraid of speech and his previous crime
Pharaoh was like I'll throw you in prison unless you worship me
Throws rod and drew out hand
Pharaoh wants all sorcerers well-versed
  Pharaoh tells sorcerers they will be raised to posts near him
Sorcerers fall down and prostrate in adoration
They flee in the night, and when at the sea he slits it
  Drowns the other

7 - 
Moses comes back for children of Israel, has to prove to Pharaoh
Sorcerer bullshit -- same as before
Moses has sorcerers throw first
Sorcerers threaten to cut of hands and feat and kill them on cross 
  Not scared because they are more afraid of the lord
Pharaoh slays all the males and females will remain powerless
Punished people of Pharaoh with years of droughts; when good times came they said this is due to us
  Connected bad times with Moses' evil omens
Sent plagues on them (Locusts, Lice, Frogs, and Blood)
  Always promised to let them go, but when taken away broke their word
People got to escape through the sea
They came upon a people devoted entirely to idols
Appointed Moses thirty nights, and ten more
When he went up charged Aaron to act for him
When Lord manifested glory of Mount, made dust and sent Moses down in swoon
Given commandments on tablets
People made calf while he was gone
  Couldn't speak or show them the way..
Immediately grabs Aaron - he says he tried wouldn't listen
Moses cools down takes up tablets and selects seventy of his people for place of meeting
They want forgiveness ladadadadaa

10 - 
After Moses and Arraon went to Pharaoh with signs
They said this is sorcery
Bring all the sorcerers
No one believed Moses except some children of his people
  Fear of being persecuted
Told Moses and Aaron to establish place of worship in their home
Took the children across the sea and drowned the others

18 - 
Moses said to attendant, I will not give up until I reach the junction of the seas or spend years in travel
Reach junction but forgot about their Fish, which took its course through the sea as in a tunnel
Moses says bring us our early meal
Satan made me forget to tell you about the fish
** Details fuzzy read more **
Procede until they get to a town where they ask for food
Slayed some man
Everyone refused them hospitality
Attendant departs..
  Boat belonged to men in dire want
  Slayed youth with parents of faith
  Wall belonged to youths, beneath it buried treasure
    Lord desired they attain their age of full strength and get our treasure

  Such is interpretation over which thou wast unable to hold patience

44 - 
Tried the people of Pharaoh
Came a messenger saying restore servants of Allah
March forth by night
Left a lot of things behind
Made other people inheirts those things

Izutsu (45-54) 
The Pessimistic Conception of the Earthly Life

pre-Islamic Arabs had some distinction between right and wrong
Right and wrong not very justifiable
  'X is good because it is good'
  'X is good because we found our forefathers doing it'
Prophet brought moral system
Bedouin Arabs knew and made use of khulud (long life that never comes to an end)
Jahili literature the idea that wealth is the most important
pre-Islamic poetry has a dark note of pessimism
Works of pre-Islamic poets resound with bitter cries of despair of emptiness of human life
Jahiliyah 
  Didn't know anything beyond world of present existence 
  Islam founded on life to come
  All is vain in this world
No longer need to seek khalud now, promise of life to come
Jahil days winebibbers a big thing - wine sign of fortune
  big wine drinkers

thoughtless generation that Muhammad came to proclaim belief in future life and final judgement
attitude of man should not be hedonism (pre-Islamic Arabs)
  rather it should be earnestness stemming out of consciousness of approach of the Last Day

karim - man is genuinely noble, real karim is one who lives with great moral earnestness
taqwa - pious fear of God

karim transformed to mean fear of God




Izutsu (55-73)
The Spirit of Tribal Solidarity

Social structure of pre-Islamic Arabia essentially tribal
tribe was sole unit and basis of social life
tribal spirit the fountainhead of all cardinal moral ideas which Arab society built
  repspect bond of kinship by blood more than anything, act in glory for tribe
tribe takes responsibility for members action, can disown to remove
Jahiliyah very tribal time

Muhammad declared superiority of religious relationship over blood
  New community based on faith in God
** Note that Muhammad profited to no slight extent from rule of tribal solidarity
Muhammad abolished tribal solidarity replacing it with faith

Medina - Muhammad tribe to establish supertribal community of all believers

pagan Arabs moral and nobility passed down, with Muhammad much more individualized
  pagan poetry boastful of one's tribe
Prophet forbid Muslims from boasting about ancestors

Noble blood prereq to development of noble qualities

Jahiliyah Social System
  weak and oppressed, slaves had no share in glorious honor handed down
Islam Social Systen
  Stressed universal grace and goodness of Allah
  No distinction between rich and poor
  All men are equal
  niggardliness is result of being a kufr (lack of gratitude towards God)

Jahiliyah
  Blood vengence supreme law of the desert
  Persistence in seeking revenge essential constituent of muruwah
  Islam between man and man
Islam
  Blood vengence vertical
  God will get vengence, supreme Avenger
  hilm - freedom from being moved and stirred up on smallest provocation

TL;DR: pagan Arabs kind of barbaric and mindless, new Arabs have more purpose and direction
